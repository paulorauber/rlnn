About
-----
Reinforcement learning with artificial neural networks in python. 

This code is intended mainly as proof of concept of action-value learning by
artificial neural networks, and was inspired by [1, 2]. 

The implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested 
or numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic 
purposes.
