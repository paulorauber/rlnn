# Reinforcement learning with artificial neural networks

This code is intended mainly as proof of concept of action-value learning by artificial neural networks, and was inspired by [1, 2, 3]. 

The implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested or numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic purposes.
